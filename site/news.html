                    <h3 id="news_1">Crypto graphic</h3>
                    <p class="textStyle">Cryptography or cryptology (from Ancient Greek: κρυπτός, romanized: kryptós "hidden, secret"; and γράφειν graphein, "to write", 
                        or -λογία -logia, "study", respectively) is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of 
                        third parties called adversaries. More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent 
                        third parties or the public from reading private messages; various aspects in information security such as data confidentiality,
                         data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation are central to modern cryptography. Modern cryptography exists at the intersection
                          of the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, electrical engineering, communication science, and physics. Applications of
                           cryptography include electronic commerce, chip-based payment cards, digital currencies, computer passwords, and military communications.
                            Cryptography prior to the modern age was effectively synonymous with encryption, the conversion of information from a readable 
                            state to apparent nonsense. The originator of an encrypted message shares the decoding technique only with intended recipients
                             to preclude access from adversaries. The cryptography literature often uses the names Alice ("A") for the sender, Bob ("B") 
                             for the intended recipient, and Eve ("eavesdropper") for the adversary.Since the development of rotor cipher machines in
                              World War I and the advent of computers in World War II, the methods used to carry out cryptology have become increasingly
                               complex and its application more widespread.
                            Modern cryptography is heavily based on mathematical theory and computer science practice; cryptographic algorithms are 
                            designed around computational hardness assumptions, making such algorithms hard to break in practice by any adversary. 
                            It is theoretically possible to break such a system, but it is infeasible to do so by any known practical means.
                             These schemes are therefore termed computationally secure; theoretical advances, e.g., improvements in integer
                              factorization algorithms, and faster computing technology require these solutions to be continually adapted.
                               There exist information-theoretically secureschemes that provably cannot be broken even with unlimited 
                               computing power—an example is the one-time pad—but these schemes are more difficult to use in practice
                                than the best theoretically breakable but computationally secure mechanisms.
                            The growth of cryptographic technology has raised a number of legal issues in the information age. Cryptography's
                             potential for use as a tool for espionage and sedition has led many governments to classify it as a weapon and
                              to limit or even prohibit its use and export. In some jurisdictions where the use of cryptography is legal,
                               laws permit investigators to compel the disclosure of encryption keys for documents relevant to an investigation.
                                Cryptography also plays a major role in digital rights management and copyright infringement of digital media.

                    The Communications Blockchain Network will first create a framework using a collaboration of various technology and business vendors,
                     which is why they have included multiple providers. This also allows consensus to be built. When the network is live, the telecom and
                      IT carriers can then choose specific vendors they are comfortable working with. Initially, this will be a collaborative framework, 
                      which will help build consensus, along with a global infrastructure,” Utpal Mangla, vice president and partner for IBM Global Business
                       Services, told me. The overall objective for the CBN is to serve the wider ICT community by avoiding fragmentation. This will 
                       accelerate the adoption of automated settlement applications, while facilitating the development of open-source standards and
                        APIs that enable service-provider interoperability.

                    For the past fourteen months the GLF and its partners have been putting rigor and processes behind this platform and we believe 
                    that now is the time to launch. The blockchain-based ecosystem has been tested with resounding success at every stage, and we 
                    believe that this platform signals nothing less than the future of ICT financial settlement,” said Louisa Gregory, Chief of 
                    Staff of Colt who also leads the GLF working group on blockchain.
                    
                    A Unique Mixture of Permissioned and Permissionless Blockchains
                    
                    While an impressive list of telecom carriers will govern the CBN, the technology providers developing the platform are
                     equally as notable, yet also very diverse. In terms of the technology being built, having providers specializing in
                      permissioned and permissionless blockchains for enterprises, which include IBM, Orbs, ConsenSys and R3, makes this project distinctive.
                    
                    Orbs, for example, is a public blockchain infrastructure designed specifically for enterprises. The platform is 
                    unique in the sense that it is designed to bring the full value of permissionless infrastructure to enterprise business.
                    
                    Orbs is very different from IBM, ConsenSys and R3. We are not a private and permissioned blockchain, but rather 
                    public and permissionless. The fact that there is potential for public blockchain for enterprise use cases is a
                     huge win for the entire market,” said Tal Kol, co-founder of Orbs. “We were able to convince the GLF that there 
                     
                     is substantial value in a public blockchain for enterprises. Our solution was built for enterprise and can 
                     facilitate such consortiums while having external, non-dependence, provably unbiased third-party verification,
                      where anyone can audit. Also, Orbs is the only infrastructure provider not represented by a system integrator,
                       meaning anyone can build on top of it.”
                    
                    On the other hand, IBM is a private, permissioned blockchain network that operates on Hyperledger Fabric. 
                    In a recent Forbes article, IBM points out that The Hyperledger Project, operated under The Linux Foundation,
                     is a “greenhouse” for growing enterprise-grade blockchain software with strong and diverse code contributors.
                    
                    IBM brings a combination of a blockchain platform and services into this mix. We are the only company that 
                    has over 500 implementations of blockchain projects worldwide. The IBM blockchain provides security,
                     provenance and transparency, which is critical for a global settlement platform. Also, we have critical
                      consortiums we have built worldwide, including IBM Food Trust and the World Wire Network, and this
                       settlement platform would fall along those lines,” said Mangla.
                    
                    In addition to IBM and Orbs, ConsenSys allows enterprises to operate on the Ethereum blockchain. 
                    According to Dr. Andreas Freund, a technology leader at ConsenSys, their solution will specifically
                     help with transactions and participant identification.
                    
                    ConsenSys can design and develop multiple-DLT solutions as evidenced by our successful execution 
                    and support of over 50 Blockchain/DLT projects operating globally. In particular for this project,
                     we propose solutions for the “transaction orchestration layer,” and decentralized identities for
                      participants in the network, solutions that have already been deployed successfully on Ethereum,
                       and can integrate with other DLTs.”
                    
                    While it’s clear that the telecommunications industry is intent on leveraging blockchain use
                     cases across its supply chains and networks, having multiple blockchain providers demonstrates
                      how the telecom industry will focus on different blockchain solutions to solve various problems.
                      
                      Yet only time will tell how everything plays out, and if permission and permissionless blockchain
                       networks can indeed work together in harmony.
                    
                    “Now that the technology partners have been chosen, the next step is for everyone to start 
                    collaborating and outline use cases in greater detail to see where each infrastructure is applicable.
                     We then need to build standards to get these to work together,” noted Kol from Orbs.

            <p class="textStyle">You’re forgiven if you aren’t familiar with a digital currency that could single-handedly devastate the planet.
                 “Six months ago I wasn’t either,” says Camilo Mora, lead author of the study. When coauthor, Katie Taladay,
                  first proposed analyzing Bitcoin’s emissions, Mora thought she was kidding. “I thought it was a video game.”
                   What came from the analysis floored the research team. From the paper: “Reducing emissions to keep warming 
                   below 2ºC is already regarded as a very difficult challenge given the increasing human population and
                    consumption as well as a lack of political will. Then came Bitcoin.”

                    *Critics of this report point to how difficult it is to calculate power usage because of how dispersed
                     the Bitcoin network is. They also point to the IT sector's efforts in reducing its footprint.
                    
                    
                    It is certainly very possible that tomorrow we create a new technology that will produce electricity 
                    without emissions," says Mora. "But it is just as possible that we do not. Are we willing to take a 
                    gamble when at stake is the viability of our planet? According to The International Energy Agency’s
                     World Energy Outlook (WEO) between 55-65% of the electricity by 2040 may still be produced by coal,
                      gas, and oil. So decarbonatiozation of electricity is something that we should push harder, 
                      but the full conversion is still far." 
                    
                    While crypto proponents argue it's unlikely that Bitcoin's energy consumption will remain fixed
                     over the next hundred years, the report's urgency is driven by the impact Bitcoin could have 
                     over the next 16-23 years, suggesting Bitcoin (and probably every area impacting climate change)
                      may have to act a lot faster to reduce carbon emissions.

                    The estimated emissions produced by Bitcoin last year alone is 69 million metric tons of CO2.
                     Mora calls the numbers mind-blowing. “That is the source of concern for us. If this [technology] 
                     is so insignificant and the footprint is so big, can you imagine if this thing were to take off? ”
                      As Bitcoin gains popularity, it’s energy demands increase dramatically. “We don’t have a single 
                      thing–not agriculture, not transportation–that we can think of that in two decades would be 
                      enough to warm the planet by two degrees. But Bitcoin can.”
                    
                    What’s causing the emissions explosion?
                    
                    Bitcoin miners are the reason for the ugly energy report card. Bitcoin has no central bank.
                     It’s a peer-to-peer decentralized network for digital currency. Bitcoin purchases generate
                      blocks of data. It’s like a folder with a complicated math problem inside as the key. 
                      A miner is simply anyone who wants to join the Bitcoin network and owns powerful 
                      Bitcoin processing hardware necessary to support the software capable of solving 
                      the key and verifying the Bitcoin. This makes Bitcoin super hard to counterfeit. 
                      As compensation for providing this level of computationally intensive security,
                       miners get a percentage of the Bitcoins they verify. But verification takes 
                       an enormous amount of energy and as Bitcoin gets more broadly adopted, 
                       the energy demands increase perilously. The current analysis suggests 
                       mining data for profit could be more destructive to the planet than 
                       mining the planet itself for profit.
